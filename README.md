# web3 nextjs template

This is a template for a web3 project using nextjs. It is a template for a project that uses the following technologies:

## How to set up this template

1. git clone the repo to your local machine, to rename the name of the folder, use the following command:

    git clone link_to_repo <new_folder_name>

2. run the init_all.sh bash-script as admin. So on linux `sudo bash init_all.sh` , on windows, I don't know! Figure out yourself! Worste case, you can just run the commands in the script manually, one by one.
